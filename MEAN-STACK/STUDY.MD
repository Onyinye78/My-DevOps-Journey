MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data. It uses a document-oriented model, where data is stored in JSON-like documents. MongoDB's schema-less nature allows for easy and dynamic data manipulation, making it ideal for agile development and rapid prototyping.


Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of robust features for building web applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware integration. It also allows for easy integration with other libraries and frameworks, making it a popular choice for building server-side applications.

Angular is a powerful front-end JavaScript framework developed by Google. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for building dynamic and responsive web applications. Angular follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, allowing for clear separation of concerns and modular development. It offers features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and component-based architecture, making it a preferred choice for building complex and interactive user interfaces.

Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance web applications. Node.js provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it efficient for handling a large number of concurrent connections. It also offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and modules, making it easy to build server-side applications and APIs.

Load balancing is the practice of distributing computational workloads between two or more computers. On the Internet, load balancing is often employed to divide network traffic among several servers. This reduces the strain on each server and makes the servers more efficient, speeding up performance and reducing latency. Load balancing is essential for most Internet applications to function properly.

The open systems interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. In plain English, the OSI provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.
Its primary goal is to guide product developers and facilitate communication across different products and software by ensuring interoperability.
