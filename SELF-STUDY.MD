Software Development lifecycle (SDLC)

TCP (TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL) AND UPD (USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL)

TCP is a connection-based protocol and UDP is connectionless. While TCP is more reliable, it transfers data more slowly. UDP is less reliable but works more quickly. TCP creates a secure communication line to ensure the reliable transmission of all data. Once a message is sent, the receipt is verified to make sure all the data was transferred. while UDP does not establish a connection when sending data. It sends data without confirming receipt or checking for errors. That means some or all of the data may be lost during transmission. TCP use critical applications SSH,HTTPS,FTP,SMTP and UDP uses by real-time appilications DNS, DHCP, SNMP, TFTP.

VIM
